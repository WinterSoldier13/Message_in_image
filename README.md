# Message_in_image
A simple python script to encode some message in an Image(pixel wise) and a de-encoder to extract the message from the image. XD

You need to rename the file as input.jpg and place it in the same folder as the scripts. :p

What is the use of this program???
I personally use it to store all my passwords in an image securely...as a backup.
